# AutoGrouping
**A client-side Fabric mod aiming at making modded item organization just a tiny bit better.**

## What does this mod do?
**AutoGrouping is an utility mod that looks for modded items in vanilla tabs and creates a new tab for these items!**

**One tab is created per mod, as long as it has at least one item in a vanilla group.**

## Why would this be useful?
**It might sound stupid and even useless ~~like some my other stuff *ahem*~~, but this is useful for big modpacks, decreasing the amount of items in the same tab, which increases organization.**

## So, can I use this in my modpack?
**Yes! Yes you can! Feel free to use it, I just ask for credits.**

## Forge? X version??
**There are currently no plans on making a Forge version.**

**I might do some backporting to versions as low as 1.16.**
